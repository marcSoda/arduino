Arduino CLI instead of the shitty desktop app:

instructions found at youtube.com/watch?v=qAM2S27FWAI

!!!!!!!!!!!!MAKE SURE TX AND RX PINS ARE DISCONNECTED BEFORE UPLOADING OR IT WILL NOT UPLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!NOTE: THE TOP LEFT USB-C PORT ON THE XPS13 IS /dev/ttyACM1!!! MAKE SURE THE MAKE FILE IN EACH DIRECTORY IS SET TO ACM1 (open the make file within the each directory and you'll see how)

if video gone:
1: make sure all .ino files are in their own folder
2: make sure a copy of the Makefile is in each folder with the .ino folder you want to run
3: run "make upload clean" inside each folder to compile, upload, then get rid of clutter
	Note: for the shitty asian nanos, they work, but you just need to try to upload them a bunch of times
	it'll say stuff like device busy or till do the counting thing, but just keep trying itll eventually work.
	not sure what the prob is

IF YOU USE SERIAL OUTPUT:
steps 1 and 2 same
3: run "make upload monitor clean" to run serial monitor over command line

COMMAND LINE SERIAL MONITOR COMMANDS:
CTRL-A then CTRL-D to hide the monitor (does not kill it)
screen -X kill : kills running screens
screen -list : displays all current running screens
screen -r displays the last displayed serial monitor
